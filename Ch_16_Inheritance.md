# Inheritance

Our game code is getting quite long. Rather than making one extremely long contract, sometimes it makes sense to split your code logic across multiple contracts to organize the code.

One feature of Solidity that makes this more manageable is contract **inheritance**:

```
contract Doge {
  function catchphrase() public returns (string memory) {
    return "So Wow CryptoDoge";
  }
}

contract BabyDoge is Doge {
  function anotherCatchphrase() public returns (string memory) {
    return "Such Moon BabyDoge";
  }
}
```

`BabyDoge` **inherits** from `Doge`. That means if you compile and deploy `BabyDoge`, it will have access to both `catchphrase()` and `anotherCatchphrase()` (and any other public functions we may define on `Doge`).

This can be used for logical inheritance (such as with a subclass, a `Cat` is an `Animal`). But it can also be used simply for organizing your code by grouping similar logic together into different contracts.
