# Bonus: Kitty Genes

Our function logic is now complete... but let's add in one bonus feature.

Let's make it so zombies made from kitties have some unique feature that shows they're cat-zombies.

To do this, we can add some special kitty code in the zombie's DNA.

If you recall from lesson 1, we're currently only using the first 12 digits of our 16 digit DNA to determine the zombie's appearance. So let's use the last 2 unused digits to handle "special" characteristics.

We'll say that cat-zombies have `99` as their last two digits of DNA (since cats have 9 lives). So in our code, we'll say `if` a zombie comes from a cat, then set the last two digits of DNA to `99`.

If statements
If statements in Solidity look just like javascript:

```
function eatBLT(string memory sandwich) public {
  // Remember with strings, we have to compare their keccak256 hashes
  // to check equality
  if (keccak256(abi.encodePacked(sandwich)) == keccak256(abi.encodePacked("BLT"))) {
    eat();
  }
}
```
